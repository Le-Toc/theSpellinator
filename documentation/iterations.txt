Purpose:  Write down the iterations of this project so that I can leave the project with a sense of
completion.

1:
What functionality do I want in the second iteration?
Add better descriptions to the words
Add in "Up Key" functionality to return the users last input
Clean up the output of the program
Allow the user to request a clue

0:
Build a program that outputs descriptions of words to the user.  Allow the user to guess what the words
are.  If the user gets it wrong tell them it's incorrect and output the description again.  If they get
it right tell them it's correct and output the next description to them.
