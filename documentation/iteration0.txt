Purpose:  Write down what iteration zero of this project is so that I can leave it finished if I want
to.

Iteration 0:
Build a program that outputs descriptions of words to the user.  Allow the user to guess what the words
are.  If the user gets it wrong tell them it's incorrect and output the description again.  If they get
it right tell them it's correct and output the next description to them.
