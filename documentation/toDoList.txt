To Do List:
    Create a final product description
    Add content to the iteration0 document
    Add in unit tests
    Look up the require_relative command, see if there is a better why to link files
    Add in the random number generator
    Add in functionality to track the number of fails a word has
    Figure out a way to save the number of fails per word between separate sessions
    Add an output method which will output all the elements in a array in order with the element number and a name at the top
    Currently the number of outputted words is 10.  Make sure that the number of words outputted can't exceed the number of words to learn.
        If the selection of words to learn is greater than the total then it will cause an infinite loop because I selected words can't have 
        duplicates.  It will continuously look for new words when there aren't any.
    Give the user the option to set the number of words to test


Finished:
    Bring objects into the program - Done
