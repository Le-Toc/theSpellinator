To Do List:

Functionality:
    Add in unit tests
    Add in functionality to track the number of fails a word has.  Figure out a way to save the number of fails per word between separate sessions
    Give the user the option to set the number of words to test.  Currently the number of outputted words is 10.  Make sure that the number of words outputted can't exceed the number of words to learn.
        If the selection of words to learn is greater than the total then it will cause an infinite loop because I selected words can't have 
        duplicates.  It will continuously look for new words when there aren't any.
    Add better descriptions to the words
    Allow the user to request a clue
    Allow the user to request the answer to the word
    Add in "Up Key" functionality to return the users last input
    Add in side key functionality to move the curser left and right
    Clean up the output of the program

Research:
    Look up the require_relative command, see if there is a better why to link files
    Look up the STDIN functionality
    Look up the switch statement
